<div class="h1">Welcome To Liefs-Layout-Manager!</div><p>
Liefs Layout Manager is a Javascript Framework (writen in Typescript) that manages the 
position of 'Div' Elements on a Page.  The position of elements on the page is determined
by using elements (Classes) of the framework, called by simple functions.
In essence, It ignores the inheritance of 'div' objects, and places them all on the first
level of the dom, using a coordinate system. (x, y, width, height) and assigns these values
in the 'style' tag of the element. Most of the 'rules' of the framework are intuitive,
and easy to learn by Novice, and Experienced Programmers Alike. This Manual is written
under this framework, and includes most of the features.  For example, try re-sizing this window
to see how the layout changes to fit all sizes.  Try the Dragbar, and tree system, all managed
by this framework.  There are TONS of examples included here to see each feature working
in it's simpleist, to most difficult form.</p>
<p>This framework only has 'divs' in the DOM that are viewed!  If a 'div' isn't currently
  desired on the screen, then it is REMOVED from the dom, and re-instroduces when required. For
example, THIS MANUAL is loaded as one page but if you check the dom (Chrome Dev Tools F12)
you will see it is CLEAN - with only the 'div's viewed existing in the DOM.</p>
<p>Liefs Layout Manager is a CLIENT SIDE framework.  It simply organizes 'div's on the screen.
  What you put in the 'div's is up to you.  It could be used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making a Web Page</li>
  <li>Making a Web Application</li>
  <li>UI for Electron projects</li>
  <li>In conjunction with other framworks</li>
</ul><p>
This framework is designed to work WITH your code, and only enhances your abilities.
All other layout systems work in conjunction with this one.  The only restriction is
you can't use the 'style' inline attribute for liefs-layout-manager divs. (but you can for child divs)
this is because the mapping system overrides these values with "left: ; top: ; width: ; height: ; zindex: " attributes.</p>
<div class="h1">Starting Point - Two Items (divs) in a horizontal container</div><br><br>
<div parentof="Example01" class="codeblock"></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">html file:</span> simply link to liefs-layout-manager! your 'div' elemnts can be
added here, like usual (see later), however in this example, all 'div's are created in the Javascript File, as the 2nd string argument
in the I() function</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">javascript file:</span> this code reads: Start a Handler (big H) with a horizontal container (small h) with two Items (Big I).
  In this case, we also added the css right here!</p>
<p>This is the basic structure for working with this framework!</p>
      </div>






      <div id="Installation">
<div class="h1">Installation</div><p>Lief Layout Manager is "installed" by simply adding
one javascript file to your html file.(index.html probably)</p>

<p>At time of posting, you can find the file under this repo:<br>
  <div class="inset">
    <a href="https://github.com/Leafdriving/liefs-layout-manager-3.0.0/">https://github.com/Leafdriving/liefs-layout-manager-3.0.0/</a>
  </div><br><br>
  <p>If you just wish to add one link to your html file (No Cors Error):</p>
  <div class="inset">
    <a href="https://leafdriving.github.io/js/liefs-layout-managerV3.0.0.js">https://leafdriving.github.io/js/liefs-layout-managerV3.0.0.js</a>
  </div><br><p>(Right-click -> save (as)) or just link to this file directly.</p>
  <p>If you wish to use npm, you can install it like this:</p>
  <div class="inset">
    npm install liefs-layout-manager --save    
  </div><br><br>
</p>
<p>This is the basic boilerplate for your code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup" style="font-size: medium;">&lt!doctype html>
&lthtml lang="en">
  &lthead>
    &ltmeta charset="utf-8">
    &lttitle>Your Title&lt/title>
    &ltscript src="./{Your Path}/liefs-layout-managerV3.0.0.js">&lt/script>
&lt!--      The above line loads the lief-layout-manager framework        -->
  &lt/head>
  &ltbody>
  &lt!-- Note - on invoking liefs-layout manager, all class="remove" are removed from the dom -->
  &ltdiv class="remove" style="font-size: larger;">Loading...&lt/div>
  &lt!-- So until invoked, the user will see the above loading page -->
  &ltdiv class="remove" style="display:none">
  &lt!-- This is where you put all 'div' elements that you wish the handler to manage
        note, they too are removed, and re-introduced to the dom only when needed --> 
  &lt/div>

  &lt/body>
&lt/html>


&lt!--  Your liefs-layout-manager code MUST come after the body to work! -->
&ltscript src="{YourPath}/yourFrameworkCode.js">&lt/script>
&lt!--  by adding a reference  to your framework script-->
&ltscript>
H( {some code} ) // invoking a handler like this starts liefs-layout-manager framework
&lt/script>    &lt!--  or just adding it to the END of your html -->
</code></pre>
      </div>


    <div id="TheBasics">
<div class="h1">Basics Of Liefs Layout Manager</div>
<p>Liefs Layout Manager is basically an Object Tree, just like all file systems.</p>
<p>Terms</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="textBlueLink">DisplayCell</span> : All nodes of the tree are contained within a DisplayCell</li>
    <li><span class="textBlueLink">DisplayGroup</span> : Holds an array of DisplayCells (Children) within a DisplayCell</li>
    <li><span class="textBlueLink">Handler</span> : Holds the "root" DisplayCell, and renders the result to the screen</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>All Objects in Liefs-layout-manager MUST have a label. If one is not specified, it will be automaticaly Generated.</p>
<p>Both CSS and 'Div' elements can OPTIONALLY be added in either the HTML file, OR the javascript part/file.</p>
<div parentof="Example01" class="codeblock"></div>
<p>We COULD just keep the html and the css like we normally do, like this:</p>
<div parentof="Example01a" class="codeblock"></div>
    </div>


    <div id="BasicsDisplayCell">
<div class="h1">The Basics Of DisplayCell</div>
<p>DisplayCell is an object that acts as a node in rendering your display.  It has is own position (x, y, width, height),
  optionally children (more display cells), and optionally a htmlBlock (basically the 'div' element should one be rendered)
</p>
<p>In our simplest example here, we have programmed everything in Javascript:</p>
    </div>

</body>
</html>
<script src="js/manual.js"></script>
<!-- <pre><code class="language-css">p { color: red }</code></pre> -->
