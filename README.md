# Liefs-Layout-Manager

Four years ago I created this:
[liefs-layout-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/liefs-layout-manager)

This repo is re-designing it from scratch.
This is a work in progress, and is not recomended
for production at this time.

Should you wish to follow along, simply download this repo, and open the *.html files to see what I'm working on.
